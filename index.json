Unlike open-source, however, there is little collaboration in open data engineering. We perform a systematic literature review of collaboration systems in open data, specifically for data engineering by users, taking place after data has been made available as open data. The results show that open data users perform a wide range of activities to acquire, understand, process and maintain data for their projects without established best practices or standardized tools for open collaboration. We identify and discuss technical, community, and process challenges to collaboration in data engineering for open data.\nDownload Paper local\nAbout Me I love getting emails!

The Softwarecampus is a project targeting self-described \u0026ldquo;EntrepreNerds\u0026rdquo; and sponsoring research projects with an industry partner with up to 100k€. Having been to a few ice-breaker events with fellow nerds I anticipated an awkward day but I was pleasantly surprised. In the hope of being pleasantly surprised again in the future, I wanted to share some ways the Softwarecampus team made the event stand out to me.\nThe environment: The kickoff event took place at the Forum Digitale Technologien in Berlin. The room we used was a large, open space and included a small exhibition of other research projects. Together with the relaxed pacing of the event, this provided interesting things to talk about and felt less like a forced getting to know people and more like an exhibition tour.\nShort, random group chats: This was the more classically-awkward part of the event but it was still well done. We were assigned to small (3-5 person) groups to present and talk about our projects to the others in about five minutes. The groups were created by gathering around home towns first and larger research areas later.\nCollaborative comic writing: This was the highlight of the event for me. With our last group (organized by research area so everyone roughly knows what the other people are doing), we were asked to choose a hero and create a three-panel comic/story that included references to our projects and how they are used to overcome challenges. We chose Alice in Wonderland and built a beautifully absurd story about how Alice has to find good open data (my project) to convince the sexist Mad Hatter and his bunnies that they are wrong and she should be let into Wonderland. While we talked about our story, artists walked from group to group and drew the comic panels from descriptions (edited to add a link to their business: Miss Vizzz). Because we had to try to find a way to fit references to all our projects into the story, we had to discuss what we were doing in detail but always with the absurd background of helping Alice into Wonderland. Finally, we had to explain our story (and by extension our projects) to the artists and present our story to the group. All of this made for a fun activity that, without feeling forced, communicated a lot of info about everyone\u0026rsquo;s goals.\nIn the end, we voted on who had the best story and presentation, we did not win (which, for the record I heavily disagree with and is a scandal) and went on to have a nice dinner. So, thank you Softwarecampus-Team (Susanne \u0026amp; Stefan) and other people planning kickoff events for nerds: Consider hiring artists and drawing some comics.\nKickoff Participants\n","permalink":"https://heltweg.org/posts/swc-kickoff/","summary":"At the start of July, I visited the Softwarecampus Kickoff Event.

I never was a member because the minimum level required was 50 and I never made it above 18. But they took me under their wings, let me train with them and took me on some raids. It was a nice time filled with late nights trying to make my sorcerer better at shielding and 120€ internet bills.\nA lot of emails and security questions later my account was officially back and I could play again. As with all modern things Tibia now has a premium account (which I bought to upgrade my character from a Sorcerer to a Master Sorcerer).\nMaster Sorcerer Rhazn\nAfter I satisfied my nostalgia I was content to just let my premium time run out and not come back. But then I thought - could I actually find a fitting end for my 10+ year Tibia journey? What about the promise CipSoft made to me?\nI asked around how and where a level 35 Master Sorcerer might be able to solo kill a dragon and found out that some of them spawn near the old dwarven city of Kazordoon.

It covers concepts from tools in ML like supervised- or unsupervised learning, tips for their application with algorithm rating and debugging and much more. Most topics are covered very timeless with the theory and math behind them being the focus.\nCoursera offers video lectures, lecture notes (as pdf) and a short text summary for most of the 11 weeks of the course.

While the content stays excellent the written summaries disappear, sometimes obvious double takes that should have been edited are left in videos and programming exercises have a lot of pre-written code in their descriptions.\nSolving programming assignments in Octave: Probably due to the age of the course the setup of Octave is not friction free - in the version I used the \u0026ldquo;pause\u0026rdquo; function was broken which made all programming assignments hang at the first stop. It was relatively easy for me to debug and fix by overwriting the internal pause function but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen quite a few questions about Octave issues in the forum. In addition Octave seems to not be the primary choice in the ML community but since the course teaches concepts over concrete implementation that is fine by me.\nNotes I took a lot of notes during the course (more than 120 pages to be exact).

Javascript provides the static property Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER as 9007199254740991 which is smaller than the id in the example tweet already.\nTo work with tweet ids we need a way to handle bigger numbers and use the \u0026ldquo;id_str\u0026rdquo;. big.js provides that functionality and is used in all following code examples.\n.freelance { border: 1px var(--theme-color-foreground) solid; padding: 24px; margin: 24px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; } .freelance__button { background-color: var(--theme-color-background) !important; color: var(--theme-color-foreground) !important; background-color: red; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none !important; display: block; max-width: 50%; text-align: center; margin: 1em; }  I am a freelancer and would love to help you! EMAIL ME 👋  Saving tweets Saving tweets in MongoDB is easy. Since we are using typescript we can rely on the excellent (Typegoose library)[https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose] to create models for tweets and interact with MongoDB:\nimport { prop, Typegoose, index } from \u0026#34;@hasezoey/typegoose\u0026#34;; @index({ \u0026#34;entities.user_mentions.screen_name\u0026#34;: 1 }) export class TwitterStatus extends Typegoose { @prop({ required: true, unique: true, index: true }) id_str!: string; @prop({ required: true }) full_text!: string; @prop({ required: true }) entities!: { user_mentions: { screen_name: string }[] } @prop({ required: true }) created_at!: string; } export const TwitterStatusModel = new TwitterStatus().getModelForClass(TwitterStatus, { schemaOptions: { strict: false } }); Notice I only defined some properties I wanted to use in this model \u0026amp; the index is also related to my use case. You might need to change those depending on the project.\nIf schemaOptions define strict as false (see the last line) typegoose saves the whole JSON of the tweet in MongoDB, not just defined fields.\nImport logic To optimize the amount of tweets you can crawl from the API in the limits twitter provides an excellent resource on using the since_id and max_id parameters correctly here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/guides/working-with-timelines.\nIn summary this means:\n set the since_id to the highest tweet id your application has already imported defining a lower bound for the imported tweets set the max_id to the max_id from the last import and subtract 1 defining the upper bound import tweets while setting max_id to the lowest id in the returned list until no new ones are returned, moving the upper bound closer to the lower bound once no new tweets are returned set max_id to undefined to remove the upper bound for future imports  If you want to crawl all mentions for an account you can keep track of your crawl status with this model:\nimport { prop, Typegoose } from \u0026#34;@hasezoey/typegoose\u0026#34;; export class TwitterCrawlStatus extends Typegoose { @prop({ required: true, unique: true, lowercase: true, trim: true }) account!: string; @prop({ trim: true }) sinceId?: string; @prop({ trim: true }) maxId?: string; @prop({ trim: true }) overallMaxId?: string; } export const TwitterCrawlStatusModel = new TwitterCrawlStatus().getModelForClas(TwitterCrawlStatus); A basic algorithm without any safeguards against failing that uses that logic and imports all mentions for a specific account follows:\nwhile(true) { const twitterCrawlStatus = await TwitterCrawlStatusModel.findOne({ account: account }; if (!twitterCrawlStatus) { twitterCrawlStatus = await TwitterCrawlStatusModel.create({ account: account }); await twitterCrawlStatus.save(); } const tweets = await twitterService.getMentions( account, twitterCrawlStatus.sinceId ? Big(twitterCrawlStatus.sinceId) : undefined, twitterCrawlStatus.maxId ? Big(twitterCrawlStatus.maxId).minus(1) : undefined, ); if (tweets.length \u0026gt; 0) { await TwitterStatusModel.bulkWrite(tweets.map(tweet =\u0026gt; { return { updateOne: { filter: { id_str: tweet.id_str }, update: { $set: tweet }, upsert: true } } })); const lowestId = (getLowestId(tweets) as Big); const highestId = (getHighestId(tweets) as Big); twitterCrawlStatus.maxId = lowestId.toFixed(); if (!twitterCrawlStatus.overallMaxId || Big(twitterCrawlStatus.overallMaxId).lt(highestId)) { twitterCrawlStatus.overallMaxId = highestId.toFixed(); } } else { twitterCrawlStatus.sinceId = twitterCrawlStatus.overallMaxId; twitterCrawlStatus.maxId = undefined; } await twitterCrawlStatus.save(); if (tweets.length === 0) { break; } } The twitter service .freelance { border: 1px var(--theme-color-foreground) solid; padding: 24px; margin: 24px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; } .freelance__button { background-color: var(--theme-color-background) !important; color: var(--theme-color-foreground) !important; background-color: red; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none !important; display: block; max-width: 50%; text-align: center; margin: 1em; }  I am a freelancer and would love to help you!

EMAIL ME 👋  GKE Preemptible nodes, your own chaos monkey To save costs I chose to use \u0026ldquo;Preemtible VMs\u0026rdquo; as nodes to power my kubernetes cluster on GKE. According to google\u0026rsquo;s docs: \u0026ldquo;Preemptible VMs are Google Compute Engine VM instances that last a maximum of 24 hours and provide no availability guarantees.\u0026rdquo; This means the nodes in my kubernetes cluster randomly go down and are never up more than 24h. While this obviously is not a smart decision for a production setup I have chosen to embrace it and consider the nodes going down my own \u0026ldquo;chaos monkey\u0026rdquo; that forces me to write resilient code.\nA concrete example I ran into: The Let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt production API has a rate limit of requesting 5 certificates for the same URL in a week. Because my initial naive setup did not save the certificate anywhere it got lost whenever my Traefik node was terminated. While Traefik regenerates the certificate without any issue on startup\u0026hellip; after five startups I hit my rate limit and was greeted by an insecure warning without certificate.\nShared K/V store for Traefik with Zookeeper Enter a shared Key/Value store for Traefik. Using one is required if you want to run Traefik in cluster mode anyway (and I like to think my setup is easily scalable). It also means I can store my generated certificate in the K/V store where it will no longer just disappear when Traefik restarts.\nSince I have previous experience with Zookeeper and the setup was relatively painless I went with it.\nAll Kubernetes yaml files for the setup Finally the meat of the blog post, my complete setup as yaml files you can directly deploy into your GKE cluster:\nSet up Zookeeper first From this excellent ressource: https://github.com/kow3ns/kubernetes-zookeeper/blob/master/manifests/README.md\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: zk-hs labels: app: zk spec: ports: - port: 2888 name: server - port: 3888 name: leader-election clusterIP: None selector: app: zk --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: zk-cs labels: app: zk spec: ports: - port: 2181 name: client selector: app: zk --- apiVersion: apps/v1beta1 kind: StatefulSet metadata: name: zk spec: serviceName: zk-hs replicas: 1 podManagementPolicy: Parallel updateStrategy: type: RollingUpdate template: metadata: labels: app: zk spec: affinity: podAntiAffinity: requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: - labelSelector: matchExpressions: - key: \u0026#34;app\u0026#34;

And if all else fails the old reliable \u0026ldquo;drag and drop files to a ftp\u0026rdquo; is always there - so why invest time into setting up your own personal cloud with kubernetes?\nMy goal for technology is typically to find a setup that gets boring to work with because I know it well and can focus on delivering new functionality. For that a setup needs to be future proof (so it continues to work for a long time), generic (so I can use it for a wide range of applications and do not need to switch for every project) and not bound to any company or product.\nDocker \u0026amp; kubernetes Docker and Kubernetes check most of these boxes. Kubernetes has de-facto won the orchestration war for containerized applications and managed kubernetes offerings from all major cloud providers means there is no provider lock-in. As an open source project that is not bound to individual company or setup you retain flexibility. Lastly learning more about it is useful in any case - if you stop developing your side projects the devops knowledge you gained still looks good on a CV.\nA further important point that separates kubernetes from similar offerings is that you can 100% forget about hardware while still being free to use standard technology. That means you do not need to maintain a set of servers if you use a managed kubernetes offering (like you would need to with docker swarm) but you are still not locked into any provider (like you would be by using AWS Beanstalk, Firebase or Heroku).\n.freelance { border: 1px var(--theme-color-foreground) solid; padding: 24px; margin: 24px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; } .freelance__button { background-color: var(--theme-color-background) !important; color: var(--theme-color-foreground) !important; background-color: red; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none !important; display: block; max-width: 50%; text-align: center; margin: 1em; }  I am a freelancer and would love to help you! EMAIL ME 👋  Why not\u0026hellip;? My own personal journey has made me try out the following alternatives in the order they are written down here and I have abandoned them all.\n Own servers  You need to maintain and update your own servers. If you do it without automation you will forget what you did. The complexity and learning curve is close to kubernetes anyway. Instead of learning about deployments and stateful sets you will need to know about processes or package managers. Scaling is harder.   Services (e.g. Firebase)  Very easy to set up and use, probably advisable if you work on one or a few projects Using vendor specific tools (like firebase realtime database) locks you and the logic of your app into that vendor. What if they change their offering (price? functionality?) Services are the hammer that makes very problem look like a nail. Instead of picking the best technology for a job you will start trying to shoehorn your problems to be solved by what is available.   Docker Swarm  I really liked it, very close to kubernetes but considerably easier Sadly still forces you to manage your own servers to set up the swarm cluster, I could not find a \u0026ldquo;managed docker swarm\u0026rdquo; solution (if you know one, let me know!)    The value of infrastructure as code By choosing kubernetes you also commit to keeping your infrastructure in code which has a plethora of benefits:\n it automatically and correctly documents your infrastructure and any changes you made by reading git logs you can easily redeploy it on new providers or e.g. locally for development all your infrastructure is in one place so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to think about how each project solved a problem  Organizing your projects For my personal cloud I chose:\n A Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine Cluster as cloud  Traefik as ingress router to forward requests to my projects Zookeeper for shared state between Traefik nodes Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt to automatically set up HTTPS   Every project has it\u0026rsquo;s own Google Cloud Container Registry as a private docker repository Service accounts allow the GKE cloud to pull the docker images of individual projects from the respective repository Infrastructure descriptions for the generic GKE setup and services is in one place, infrastructure descriptions for the individual projects is in their respective code Deployment is handled with gitlab  Further reading  Read my blog post about the actual setup of this cloud: /posts/run-a-personal-cloud-with-traefik-lets-encrypt-and-zookeeper.

EMAIL ME 👋  I started my development with artemists, a Typescript port of artemis by darkoverlordofdata. Unfortunately the code is a bit outdated and does not use import/export and can not be directly imported for newer Typescript versions (since it extends the built-in Array).\nWith darkoverlordofdata’s permission I did a quick update to the Typescript parts of the code only, adding import/export support and fixing the build for newer Typescript versions. You can find the updated version here. If you are looking for an example of that framework in action you can play an example level of Frozzen here.\nAbout Me I love getting emails!

Easy to set up and maintain (I don\u0026rsquo;t want to set up and host databases or complicated CMS systems and when I come back to this in a month it should be easy to update.) Long term secure storage (By not hosting my content with a third party but in git I can easily back it up, keep old revisions and there is no worry of the hosting provider going down.)  All these requirements are solved by using a static site generator and keeping the original files versioned in git. When setting up some for of continuous integration (for example with gitlab) it should be reasonably easy to maintaining for a long time.\nI chose gohugo as a site generator due to the excellent setup article written by Fabian Gruber here: https://www.fabiangruber.de/posts/setup-and-deployment\nAutomated builds I set up an automated build using gitlab using the following gitlab-ci.yml:\nstages: - build build: image: monachus/hugo:v0.55.3 stage: build script: - hugo artifacts: paths: - public/ This uses a docker image for Hugo and builds the static page from the sources provided.\nContinuous delivery I chose firebase to host the website because I have previous experience with it. It is very easy to create and deploy a static website as well as wire it up with a HTTPS domain.\nAfter creating a new project in firebase you\u0026rsquo;ll need to get a token that allows gitlab to make deployments on your behalf:\nfirebase login:ci Set it up as a secret variable in gitlab called \u0026ldquo;FIREBASE_TOKEN\u0026rdquo;.\nTo add firebase to the gohugo project navigate to the directory in the CLI can call:\nfirebase init Armed with the token that allows gitlab to deploy in your name as well as a configured firebase project we can add the last step to the gitlab-ci file - deployment.\n.freelance { border: 1px var(--theme-color-foreground) solid; padding: 24px; margin: 24px; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; } .freelance__button { background-color: var(--theme-color-background) !important; color: var(--theme-color-foreground) !important; background-color: red; padding: 1em 1.5em; text-decoration: none !important; display: block; max-width: 50%; text-align: center; margin: 1em; }  I am a freelancer and would love to help you!
