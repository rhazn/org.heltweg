      <title>mealpreplist.com - Your weekly mealprep, made easy</title>

      <description>Meal prepping is the practice of preparing multiple meals at once and either freezing them or keeping them in the fridge to eat over the upcoming days. There is an active community on reddit (r/MealPrepSunday/) and various blogs online.
Often mealprep containers are separated in three sections for a carb source, a protein source and vegetables.
With mealpreplist I wanted to save my own, simple meal components for each of these sections and allow myself an easy way of combining them to a meal to prepare.</description>

      <title>Whatchr.com - a better youtube playlist experience</title>
      <link>https://heltweg.org/projects/whatchr-dot-com-a-better-youtube-playlist-experience/</link>

      <description>Whatchr was born of a personal problem. I regularly watch let&amp;rsquo;s play content on youtube (following a group of content creators with their series), mainly following the channels of The Yogscast.
Youtube&amp;rsquo;s focus is on either suggesting content it thinks you find interesting on your &amp;ldquo;Suggestions&amp;rdquo; or content divided in daily chunks in your &amp;ldquo;Feed&amp;rdquo;. There is no nice way to watch multiple series other than bookmarking playlists with watch positions.</description>
