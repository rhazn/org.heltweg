      <description>Our paper &amp;ldquo;Challenges to Open Collaborative Data Engineering&amp;rdquo; got accepted to the Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences 2023 (HICSS 56).
Abstract Open data is data that can be used, modified, and passed on, for free, similar to open-source software. Unlike open-source, however, there is little collaboration in open data engineering. We perform a systematic literature review of collaboration systems in open data, specifically for data engineering by users, taking place after data has been made available as open data.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&amp;rdquo;
 - Phil Karlton
AngularJS was released in 2010 and revolutionized modern frontend development. In 2016, the AngularJS team published a new framework, written in TypeScript and incompatible with AngularJS. They also made the baffling choice to call this framework Angular 2.
Mayhem ensued, confused developers talked to each other about incompatible frameworks. The excellent community documentation AngularJS had built in the form of blogs and StackOverflow answers became an active hindrance for people trying to learn Angular.</description>

      <title>Master Thesis: Implementing a Structured Approach to Belief Revision by Deterministic Switching Between Total Preorders</title>
      <link>https://heltweg.org/posts/master-thesis/</link>

      <description>Abstract Belief change research investigates how agents adapt their knowledge with potentially conflicting information. A common formalization is by epistemic states, abstract entities often represented by faithful preorders. Operators describe how epistemic states change with new evidence and are classified by which postulates they satisfy. Different approaches have been suggested for the problem of iterated belief change. Recent work introduces uniform revision that revises an agent&amp;rsquo;s beliefs based on one static total preorder, therefore lowering representational costs.</description>

      <description>Note: An extended version of this paper has been published at the 7th Workshop on Formal and Cognitive Reasoning, you can find it here.
Our paper &amp;ldquo;Certification of Iterated Belief Changes via Model Checking and its Implementation&amp;rdquo; got accepted to the 19th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR-2021) at the 18th International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2021). During the workshop I held a short presentation of the results.</description>
