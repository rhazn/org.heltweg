      <description>At the start of July, I visited the Softwarecampus Kickoff Event. The Softwarecampus is a project targeting self-described &amp;ldquo;EntrepreNerds&amp;rdquo; and sponsoring research projects with an industry partner with up to 100kâ‚¬. Having been to a few ice-breaker events with fellow nerds I anticipated an awkward day but I was pleasantly surprised. In the hope of being pleasantly surprised again in the future, I wanted to share some ways the Softwarecampus team made the event stand out to me.</description>
