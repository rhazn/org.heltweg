      <description>With my personal cloud setup based on kubernetes done (you can read about it here: https://heltweg.org/posts/run-a-personal-cloud-with-traefik-lets-encrypt-and-zookeeper/) it is time to actually deploy the first project into it.
The easiest application to deploy is a pure client side single page application, packaged in a docker container with a webserver like nginx to deliver the files. Packaging the application into it&amp;rsquo;s own container allows us to build a standardized container that can be run locally for testing or deployed to docker swarm and kubernetes.</description>

      <title>mealpreplist.com - Your weekly mealprep, made easy</title>

      <description>Meal prepping is the practice of preparing multiple meals at once and either freezing them or keeping them in the fridge to eat over the upcoming days. There is an active community on reddit (r/MealPrepSunday/) and various blogs online.
Often mealprep containers are separated in three sections for a carb source, a protein source and vegetables.
With mealpreplist I wanted to save my own, simple meal components for each of these sections and allow myself an easy way of combining them to a meal to prepare.</description>
