      <description>Whatchr was born of a personal problem. I regularly watch let&amp;rsquo;s play content on youtube (following a group of content creators with their series), mainly following the channels of The Yogscast.
Youtube&amp;rsquo;s focus is on either suggesting content it thinks you find interesting on your &amp;ldquo;Suggestions&amp;rdquo; or content divided in daily chunks in your &amp;ldquo;Feed&amp;rdquo;. There is no nice way to watch multiple series other than bookmarking playlists with watch positions.</description>
