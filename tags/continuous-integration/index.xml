      <description>As the final step in this long series of blogposts we are going to deploy a simple webapp in a docker container to my personal cloud. For context here is the personal cloud setup with Traefik/Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt (Run a personal cloud with Traefik, Let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt and Zookeeper).
In previous blogposts I also described how I built the app (Build a PWA in docker).
App deployment The deployment runs the docker container.</description>

      <description>In previous blogposts I explained my concept of a personal cloud for my own projects (Kubernetes for Sideprojects) and how I set it up (Run a personal cloud with Traefik, Let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt and Zookeeper). I also showed how I packaged a PWA project with docker (Build a PWA in docker).
With all those ingredients ready to go the last hurdle to solve is building the docker image automatically as well as publishing it to a private container registry so I can deploy it to my cloud from there.</description>

      <description>In a previous blogpost I showed how I build and publish docker images on gitlab ci (Build a docker image on gitlab ci)
Make sure to read that post first for an overview and permission setup.
Update the kubernetes service with the new docker image You can easily set up a deploy step using google&amp;rsquo;s own cloud SDK docker images. Note the service account with the permissions to change the kubernetes setup is saved as &amp;ldquo;GCLOUD_K8S_KEY&amp;rdquo; variable here.</description>
