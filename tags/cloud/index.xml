      <description>Kubernetes ingress with Traefik As mentioned in my last blog post I want to focus on a provider neutral setup for my own cloud, using technology that is not bound to any cloud offering whenever possible.
While google cloud offers load balanced HTTP ingress by default it is apparently very expensive in comparison to running small nodes and I have heard only good things about using Traefik for kubernetes ingress.</description>

      <description>Why invest in a personal cloud It has never been easier to host your personal side projects. Tools like surge.sh or Heroku make it painless to run your code. And if all else fails the old reliable &amp;ldquo;drag and drop files to a ftp&amp;rdquo; is always there - so why invest time into setting up your own personal cloud with kubernetes?
My goal for technology is typically to find a setup that gets boring to work with because I know it well and can focus on delivering new functionality.</description>
