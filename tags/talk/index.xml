      <description>The following slides where created for my Talk &amp;ldquo;Not all those who wander are lost â€” Lessons from five years of learning and working remotely&amp;rdquo; for the Alumni Organisation of the Software Campus. They lose a lot of context without the actual talk but maybe they are of some interest.
Abstract After COVID, many knowledge workers have some experience with remote work. With more and more jobs going back to pre-pandemic setups, it is a good time to look back and reflect on what worked, what did not work and which best-practices support remote working while mitigating its downsides.</description>
