      <description>Blog requirements I recently evaluated what how writing content and carving out a little personal space on the internet would look like for me and came up with a list of requirements:
 Own my content (No third party platforms as only distribution method. There was a time before medium and there will be a time after medium.) Easy to set up and maintain (I don&amp;rsquo;t want to set up and host databases or complicated CMS systems and when I come back to this in a month it should be easy to update.</description>

      <description>Meal prepping is the practice of preparing multiple meals at once and either freezing them or keeping them in the fridge to eat over the upcoming days. There is an active community on reddit (r/MealPrepSunday/) and various blogs online.
Often mealprep containers are separated in three sections for a carb source, a protein source and vegetables.
With mealpreplist I wanted to save my own, simple meal components for each of these sections and allow myself an easy way of combining them to a meal to prepare.</description>
